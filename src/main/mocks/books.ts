With the help of case studies and surveys this book explores the economic and political forces driving Dubai’s urban growth, its changing urbanity and its place within the global city network. Uniquely, it looks beyond the glamour of Dubai’s mega-projects, and provides an in-depth exploration of a select set of spaces which reveal the city’s ‘inner life’.",

          "description": "In many respects 2014 marked the transition from strong recovery to promising growth for Dubai. With many exciting projects in the pipeline, not least the hosting of Expo 2020, the emirate is continuing to build on its reputation as a dynamic and international centre for business. Already a regional and global centre for business and finance, Dubai’s reputation has been bolstered by the MSCI’s decision to upgrade the UAE from frontier to emerging market status in 2014, while the emirate’s successful Expo 2020 bid is expected to generate myriad opportunities for private investors across a range of sectors. Construction is thriving once again, driven in large part by strong retail sector growth, with various projects, including plans for the world’s largest mall, indicating that the sector will maintain its position as the emirate’s biggest GDP contributor moving forward. The transport and logistics framework is set for major expansion in the coming years as well, furthering cementing the emirate’s status as a leading transport and logistics hub not just regionally, but globally too. The continued development of Dubai’s retail and hospitality offerings, alongside the upgrades to its airports, should help to ensure robust growth in visitor numbers from both the region and further afield.",

          "description": "Over the last 50 years, Dubai has transformed itself from a small fishing and trading village into an integrated, modern, and vibrant economy. The development process was initiated by oil richness but, unlike most other oil exporters, it has successfully diversified away from hydrocarbons with the creation of world-class clusters of financial services, tourism, and trading activities. Understandably, Dubai has become a model of economic development not only for the other six emirates that comprise the UAE, but also for most regional economies. Indeed, its success in diversifying its economic base makes Dubai an interesting case study for any resource-dependent economy wishing to achieve sustainable prosperity by engaging in better-balanced growth paths than those typically induced by the exploitation of natural resources. This book provides a comprehensive economic and historical account of the evolution of the economy of Dubai since the foundation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971. It focuses on its transformations and experiences and the roles played by government policies and private sector initiatives. Based on solid analysis, it provides a perspective and policy recommendations on the way forward in an intensely increasing competitive global economy.",

In just two decades; Dubai has reinvented itself from a small; poor and quiet fishing village to a dazzling city with a vibrant urban life. How did this happen? Home to more than 200 nationalities—particularly those from the Indian subcontinent—the emirate’s choice to welcome expatriates has paid off. Cultivating an open and welcoming culture; Dubai manages to attract people from all over the world; heartily embracing any entrepreneurial contribution they wish to make. The emirate is now also known for its cosmopolitan melting-pot culture; and its enabling environment to conduct business; and this; along with the tax-free system and hassle-free infrastructure; makes it a much sought-after site for multinational enterprises who want a base in Asia. Unlike the Gulf emirates that can count on petroleum wealth; Dubai has wound its way to prosperity by planning carefully and executing those plans methodically. Its airline and luxury construction have made it a popular destination for luxury tourism. Projects like the Burj al-Arab; the Palm Jumeriah and the Burj Khalifa; along with events like the world’s richest horserace—the Dubai World Cup—and the Dubai Shopping Festival; have sustained tourist interest and focused the world’s attention on the emirate. Pranay Gupte draws on his deep knowledge of the region and its leading personalities to trace the city-state’s extraordinary and fabulous journey.",

This book explains the reasons for the emergence of Dubai and its distinctive development trajectory, arguing that the decision, in the 1970s, to invest in infrastructure made possible by shipping containerization laid the foundations for its future expansion. The book shows that in contrast to its competitors' hydrocarbon rentier economic model, Dubai's creation and expansion of ports and airports, together with 'value-added' logistics and business-friendly enhancements, were used to out-compete regional rivals. Drawing on a range of primary and secondary sources, including interviews with logistics business-people, government records, memoirs, it fills a significant lacuna in the history of Dubai's development and emergence as a global trade hub.",

The most opulent hotels in the world fight for attention with open tracts of desert that stretch, uninhabited, to the horizon. Hundreds of kilometres of sandy beaches, which run into the warm and clear waters of the Arabian Gulf, are only interrupted by desalination plants that create enough fresh water to keep acres of Dubai public gardens in luscious bloom. No expense has been spared to make Dubai a five-star paradise for up-market tourists looking for great food and drink, extraordinary duty free shopping, and all-year round sunshine. Discover sunken wrecks that attract divers from around the world; nightclubs hosting Europe and Asia's hottest DJs; desert driving in death defying conditions; restaurants run by globally renowned chefs; and shopping trips that mix bazaars full of ancient Iranian spices with tax free-priced suits from Armani and Versace. *Sightseeing in Dubai *Dubai hotels *Dubai restaurants *Dubai bars *Dubai shops *Dubai maps",

          "description": "Award-winning journalist Jim Krane charts the history of Dubai from its earliest days, considers the influence of the family who has ruled it since the nineteenth century, and looks at the effect of the global economic downturn on a place that many tout as a blueprint for a more stable Middle East The city of Dubai, one of the seven United Arab Emirates, is everything the Arab world isn't: a freewheeling capitalist oasis where the market rules and history is swept aside. Until the credit crunch knocked it flat, Dubai was the fastest-growing city in the world, with a roaring economy that outpaced China's while luring more tourists than all of India. It's one of the world's safest places, a stone's throw from its most dangerous. In City of Gold, Jim Krane, who reported for the AP from Dubai, brings us a boots-on-the-ground look at this fascinating place by walking its streets, talking to its business titans, its prostitutes, and the hard-bitten men who built its fanciful skyline. He delves into the city's history, paints an intimate portrait of the ruling Maktoum family, and ponders where the city is headed. Dubai literally came out of nowhere. It was a poor and dusty village in the 1960s. Now it's been transformed into the quintessential metropolis of the future through the vision of clever sheikhs, Western capitalists, and a river of investor money that poured in from around the globe. What has emerged is a tolerant and cosmopolitan city awash in architectural landmarks, luxury resorts, and Disnified kitsch. It's at once home to America's most prestigious companies and universities and a magnet for the Middle East's intelligentsia. Dubai's dream of capitalism has also created a deeply stratified city that is one of the world's worst polluters. Wild growth has clogged its streets and left its citizens a tiny minority in a sea of foreigners. Jim Krane considers all of this and casts a critical eye on the toll that the global economic downturn has taken. While many think Dubai's glory days have passed, insiders like Jim Krane who got to know the city and its creators firsthand realize there's much more to come in the City of Gold, a place that, in just a few years, has made itself known to nearly every person on earth.",

          "description": "When Jillian Schedneck takes up a position teaching English to a classroom of UAE students in Abu Dhabi, she is young, idealistic, in love, and ready to take on the world. But it is not exactly what she anticipated: her mostly female students are only attending university as a token distraction from what will become a life spent attending to domestic duties, and Jillian struggles with the limitations to their futures that they seem to so readily accept. Facing the contradicting culture of extreme wealth and luxury, but little real opportunity, Jillian finds herself deeply intrigued by the women of the UAE. As she negotiates her way around classrooms of unlikely students, they start to come alive as Jillian introduces them to writers such as Virginia Woolf, and poses questions about feminism. But she is not only opening up a new world to them. She also finds her own cultural assumptions being challenged, and begins to realise how much her time in these desert cities have shaped the woman she will become. Reminiscent of Nine Parts of Desire and Reading Lolita in Tehran, this compelling memoir announces the arrival of an exciting new writer.",

          "description": "What does it mean to be cosmopolitan? To be a crossroads, a gathering place, a center for world commerce? Explore the meaning of Dubai as a nation-state at the crossroads of the world, gathering people together from around the world. Much like Syros in ancient Greece was once at the center of world commerce, Dubai has evolved into a twenty-first-century nexus for new cosmopolitanisms. Both as a port and desert city, Adrianne Kalfopoulou imagines how Dubai has projected itself onto these screens as an idea for the future — and the present. By exploring the development of Dubai both through the lens of philosophers like Baudrillard and his \"hyperreal\" as well as by digging into the city's history, from its collapse as a pearl-diving mecca through its complex evolution into a member state of the United Arab Emirates. On The Gaze: Dubai and its new Cosmopolitanisms fleshes out the story of Dubai, revealing it through multiple gazes. Kalfopoulou's evocative writing and inward searching brings readers along as she examines what Dubai means to her, to the Arab world, and to the world as a whole. \"We follow Kalfopoulou's multiple gazes—temporal, abstract, theoretical, and personal—and journey with her from Dubai's humble beginnings as a port village to its evolution as a global city of the digital age. The book abounds in honest and vivid portraits of people and places written in beautifully crafted prose. A very welcome addition to the growing body of anglophone literature on the Arabian Gulf.\" – Yahya Haidar, editor and translator, Al-Din, A Prolegomenon to the Study of the History of Religions.",
